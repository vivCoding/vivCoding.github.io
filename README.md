### TODO

- make webpage no-js friendly
- make webpage prefer-no-motion friendly
- somehow make Tailwind dev simpler. It's kinda annoying to have to recompile the CSS file
- maybe setup deployment workflow (have it deploy from specific folder/command or whatever)
- explore other css framework (maybe postcss)
