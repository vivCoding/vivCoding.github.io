I've been thinking about doing this for awhile. Ever since I learned ANOVA methods in my statistics class back in 2nd year of college, I wanted some place to just put notes of my thought processes somewhere where I can easily access anywhere.

Too bad it's been awhile and I don't remember how to do ANOVA now.
