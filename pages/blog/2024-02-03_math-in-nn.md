For class, I had to implement a neural network from scratch, using only basic PyTorch Tensor operations. It was a great refresher on the math behind a neural network. Though, that doesn't make implementing and visualizing the math easier.

I write this to remind my future self on the intuition behind the math in the neural network, in case I want a refresher, or if I ever have to write a neural network from scratch again (when pigs start flying). I won't be discussing what each layer does or why we use certain layers, per se. I wanted to show how we derived the forward and backward passes (_especially_ the backward pass).

## Setup

The model we'll describe will be a classification model. It takes in input(s), and outputs a probability distribution describing how likely it is to be a specific class. It will consist of the following layers, in order:

1. Linear
2. ReLU
3. Softmax

For our loss function, we'll use the negative log likelihood (NLL) function.

> **PLEASE NOTE** that this is for learning purposes. In practice, depending on what you want (say for classification), you may not want ReLU as the last layer.

> For classification, the cross entropy loss is equivalent to having a softmax layer and using NLL loss. So, you can simplify softmax and NLL loss to be the cross entropy loss function. However, I prefer to keep them separate to make math easier to grasp.

Typically, most guides describe the input $x$ to the model as a vector with $D_{in}$ input features. However, we usually train over multiple examples (a batch size $N$). Thus, in this guide, we'll define our input to our model as a matrix with dimensions $N \times D_{in}$. Each row in the input is one training example.

Similarly, our model output will be a $N \times D_{out}$ matrix, where $D_{out}$ represents the number of output features (the number of classes we can predict).

With the model's core dimensions defined, let's dive into the specifics of each layer and the forward pass of the neural network.

> Note, I'll define variables that are probably not very common in other tutorials. Idc. These variables made sense to me when I was first learning it.

## Linear layer

The linear layer is defined as $h = Wx + b$ (though we may rearrange the matrices multiplication to match dimensions). We will use $h$ to represent the output of the linear layer.

> I find it more intuitive to do $h = xW + b$, rather than having to do transposing and all that jazz. So I will do that. The actual order of matrix multiplication will depend on how you define dimensions and whatever

If we had _one training example_, our matrix multiplication would look something like this:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x_0 & ... & x_{D_{in}}
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
W_{0, 0} & ... & W_{D_{out}} \\
... & ... & ... \\
W_{D_{in},0} & ... & W_{D_{in}, D_{out}}
\end{bmatrix}

+

\begin{bmatrix}
b_0 & ... & b_{D_{out}}
\end{bmatrix}

=
\begin{bmatrix}
h_0 & ... & h_{D_{out}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

But remember, we typically do training in batches and have multiple examples. Thus, our input $x$ has dimensions $N \times D_{in}$. Each row is one training example, and we have $N$ examples. Likewise, the output of the layer, $h$, will be a matrix of dimensions $N \times D_{out}$. Each row is the output for one example, and we have $N$ examples.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
h_{0, 0} & ... & h{0, D_{out}} \\
... \\
h_{N, 0} & ... & h_{N, D_{out}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Our weights $W$ will have dimensions of $D_{in} \times D_{out}$. We use the same weights for each of our examples.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
W_{0, 0} & ... & W_{D_{out}} \\
... & W_{i,j} & ... \\
W_{D_{in},0} & ... & W_{D_{in}, D_{out}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

If we do the matrix multiplication $Wx$, we get a resultant matrix of dimensions $N \times D_{out}$, matching our $h$. Each row in the output is the result of multipling weights to the corresponding input row.

The biases $b$ will have dimensions of $N \times D_{out}$. Keep in mind that we use the same bias values for all training examples. So really, $b$ is just a vector of with $D_{out}$ columns (just like we showed for the one training example), and expanded along the other dimension to have $N$ rows, so that we can add our biases to each training example.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
b_0 & ... & b_{D_{out}} \\
... \\
b_0 & ... & b_{D_{out}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Putting it together:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{0,0} & ... & x_{0,D_{out}} \\
... \\
x_{N,0} & ... & x_{N,D_{out}}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
W_{0, 0} & ... & W_{D_{out}} \\
... & W_{i,j} & ... \\
W_{D_{in},0} & ... & W_{D_{in}, D_{out}}
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
b_0 & ... & b_{D_{out}} \\
... \\
b_0 & ... & b_{D_{out}}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
h_{0, 0} & ... & h_{0, D_{out}} \\
... \\
h_{N, 0} & ... & h_{N, D_{out}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## ReLU layer

ReLU is pretty easy. It's defined as:

$$
r = max(0, h)
$$

Here, $h$ is the output from the linear layer being fed into the input of our ReLU layer. And we'll define $r$ as the output of our ReLU layer.

Essentially, what we're doing is taking _every single input_ $h_{i,j}$ from our input matrix and running it through our ReLU function, e.g. ensuring every value becomes $\geq 0$.

The dimensions of our input $h$ is $N \times D_{out}$. ReLU doesn't do any matrix transformations, so it outputs a matrix $r$ of dimensions $N \times D_{out}$ also.

## Softmax layer

Softmax is the final layer of our neural network. We use softmax to make our prediction. For each training example, it returns a probability distribution for our output features (each possible class). More explanation a lil' later.

The input to our softmax layer is the output $r$ from our ReLU layer, which has dimensions $N \times D_{out}$.

For _one training example_ (as most tutorials show), the softmax is defined as:

$$
S_i = \frac{e^{r_c}}{\sum_k e^{r_k}}
$$

For clarification:

$$
\sum_k e^{r_k} = e^{r_0} + e^{r_1} + ... + e^{r_{D_{out}}}
$$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
r_0 & ... & r_{D_{out}}
\end{bmatrix}
\Rightarrow

\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{e^{r_0}}{\sum_k e^{r_k}} & ... & \frac{e^{r_{D_{out}}}}{\sum_k e^{r_k}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Typically, softmax takes in an input vector and outputs a vector of same dimensions. This output vector represents a probability distribution - in our classification model, it represents the predicted probabilities for each class. For each column $S_i$, in the output, $S_i$ represents the probability that the training example is part of class $c$. And since this is a probability distribution, all the values in the output add up to 1.

For example, if softmax returned $[0.8, 0.15, 0.05]$, this means our model predicted that there is an 80% chance that the original input $x$ (not $r$) belongs to class index 0, and that there's a 5% chance that the input belongs to class index 2.

However, this is just for _one training example_. To extend this for our model, where we have multiple training examples and $r$ has dimensions $N \times D_{out}$, we can define our softmax as:

$$
S_{i, j} = \frac{e^{r_{i, j}}}{\sum_k e^{r_{i, k}}}
$$

For clarification:

$$
\sum_k e^{r_{i, k}} = e^{r_{i, 0}} + e^{r_{i, 1}} + ... + e^{r_{i, D_{out}}}
$$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
r_{0, 0} & ... & r_{0, D_{out}} \\
... \\
r_{N, 0} & ... & r_{N, D_{out}}
\end{bmatrix}

\Rightarrow

\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{e^{r_{0, 0}}} {\sum_k e^{r_{0, k}}} & ... & \frac{e^{r_{0, D_{out}}}} {\sum_k e^{r_{0, k}}} \\
\\ ... \\ \\
\frac{e^{r_{N, 0}}} {\sum_k e^{r_{N, k}}} & ... & \frac{e^{r_{0, D_{out}}}} {\sum_k e^{r_{N, k}}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Running through our softmax layer gives us an output matrix $S$ of dimensions $N \times D_{out}$. Each row represents the predicted probability distribution for one example. As such, if you sum up all the values in one row, it'll add up to one.

## Loss function

Softmax is our final layer in our model. It returns a predicted probability distribution for each of our training examples. Now, we need to measure how well our model did.

To do that, we will compute the negative log likelihood loss (NLL loss) for each training example. Let's look at only one for now.

$$
S = [0.8, 0.15, 0.05]
$$

Typically, our true probability distribution $y$ will look something like this for classification models:

$$
y = [1, 0, 0]
$$

Interpreting all this, this means that the input $x$ actually belongs class index 0 (it has 100% chance as shown in $y$). Our model made a prediction that the input has an 80% chance of being in index 0. So it's almost there.

How do we measure how well our model did? We'll calculate a loss value, which is a scalar value. We'll use the NLL loss equation:

$$
\mathcal{L}(y, S) = -\sum_c y_c log(S_c)
$$

It basically sums up the log likelihood for each output feature $c$ (each possible class), and takes the negative. Why negative? Because we want to minimize the total loss.

> Not gonna explain NLL right now, that's a different story

To expand this for multiple training examples, we can do something similar:

$$
\mathcal{L}(y, S) = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^N \sum_c^{D_{out}} y_{i, c} log(S_{i, c})
$$

Basically, we calculate the average loss for all $N$ training examples.

## Minimizing loss

So we go forward in our neural network with our initial input $x$, get predicted distributions $S$, and finally calculate a final loss value $\mathcal{L}$.

$$h = Wx + b$$
$$r = max(0, h)$$
$$S = \text{Softmax}(r)$$
$$\mathcal{L} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^N \sum_c^{D_{out}} y_{i, c} log(S_{i, c})$$

Now it's time to update our parameters (our weights and biases). To do so, we'll calculate the _gradient_ of our loss function with respect to our weights or biases. Recall chain rule:

$$
\frac {\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W} =
  \frac {\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial S}
  \frac {\partial S}{\partial r}
  \frac {\partial r}{\partial h}
  \frac {\partial h}{\partial W}
$$

$$
\frac {\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b} =
  \frac {\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial S}
  \frac {\partial S}{\partial r}
  \frac {\partial r}{\partial h}
  \frac {\partial h}{\partial b}
$$

Once we have the loss gradient, we can update each of our weights accordingly.

$$W_{new} = W_{old} - \nabla_W \mathcal{L}$$
$$b_{new} = b_{old} - \nabla_b \mathcal{L}$$

To do this, we need to calculate each derivative in our chain rule. Let's go through each one.

## Loss derivative

Recall our loss function:

$$\mathcal{L} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^N \sum_c^{D_{out}} y_{i, c} log(S_{i, c})$$

We need to calculate $\frac {\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial S}$. But, let's observe what this derivative looks like.

$S$ is an input with dimensions of $N \times D_{out}$. Our loss function is simply a scalar value. Thus, we need to compute the following matrix:

$$
\frac {\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial S}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac {\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial S_{0, 0}} & ... & \frac {\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial S_{0, D_{out}}} \\
... \\
\frac {\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial S_{N, 0}} & ... & \frac {\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial S_{N, D_{out}}} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
